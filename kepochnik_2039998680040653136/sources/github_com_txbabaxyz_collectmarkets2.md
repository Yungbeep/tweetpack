# Polymarket Collector & Analyzer


Interactive menu-driven application for collecting and analyzing Polymarket trading activity.


## Features


### Data Collection


- Fetch complete trading history from Polymarket wallets
- Automatic pagination and deduplication
- Export to organized CSV files (grouped by market)
- Support for unlimited wallets


### Cyclic Collection


- Automated repeated data collection at regular intervals
- Configure custom intervals (e.g., every 1, 5, 10 minutes)
- Set number of cycles (e.g., 10, 50, 100 runs)
- Automatic data merging: Markets found in multiple cycles are combined
- Duplicate removal: Transactions are deduplicated across cycles
- Progress tracking: Live countdown and cycle status
- Summary reports: Detailed cycle statistics


### Visualization


- Interactive market analysis plots
- Trade scatter plot (price vs time, point size = USDC amount)
- Cumulative contract accumulation over time
- Automatic statistics calculation
- Quality filter: Markets with <30 trades are skipped


## Requirements


- Python 3.10+
- Network access to Polymarket API


## Installation


```
# Clone or copy the project
git clone https://github.com/txbabaxyz/collectmarkets2.git
cd collectmarkets2

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or: venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure wallets
cp wallets.example.txt wallets.txt
# Edit wallets.txt with your wallet addresses
```


## Configuration


### Wallet Configuration


Edit wallets.txt in the format:


```
name,address
myWallet,0x1234567890abcdef...
trader1,0xabcdef1234567890...
```


### Application Settings


Edit these variables in collector.py:


Variable
Description


`WALLET_FILE`
Path to wallet configuration


`OUTPUT_ROOT`
CSV output directory


`PLOTS_DIR`
Plot output directory


`CYCLES_DIR`
Cyclic collection output


## Usage


### Start the Application


```
python3 collector.py
```


### Main Menu


```
POLYMARKET COLLECTOR & ANALYZER

[1] Run Wallet Analysis
[2] Add New Wallet
[3] Create Market Plot
[4] Exit
```


### Wallet Analysis Modes


[1] Single Run: Collect data once, save to CSV files


[2] Cyclic Collection: Repeat at configured intervals


- Set interval (minutes between cycles)
- Set number of cycles
- Results automatically merged


### Creating Plots


1. Select blogger (data folder)
2. Select market (CSV file)
3. Generate dual plot (scatter + accumulation)

## Plot Features


### Top Panel - Purchase Scatter


- X-axis: Timestamp
- Y-axis: Price (0-1)
- Point size: Proportional to USDC amount
- Green = UP trades, Red = DOWN trades


### Bottom Panel - Contract Accumulation


- X-axis: Timestamp
- Y-axis: Cumulative contracts
- Green line = UP, Red line = DOWN


### Statistics Box


- Total trades
- UP/DOWN: trades, contracts, USDC spent


## Example Workflows


### Basic Analysis


```
# 1. Start application
python3 collector.py

# 2. Add wallet (if needed)
[2] Add New Wallet -> Enter name & address

# 3. Run single analysis
[1] Run Wallet Analysis -> Select wallet -> [1] Single Run

# 4. Create visualization
[3] Create Market Plot -> Select data -> Select market
```


### Live Monitoring Session


```
# 1. Start cyclic collection
[1] Run Wallet Analysis
Select wallet -> [2] Cyclic Collection

# 2. Configure
Interval: 1 minute
Cycles: 60 (= 1 hour total)

# 3. Review results
Check: cycles/{wallet}_{timestamp}/merged/
```


## API Details


- Endpoint: https://data-api.polymarket.com/activity
- Rate Limiting: 0.5s delay between requests (built-in)
- Max Records: 10,000 per wallet (configurable)

- Ensure CSV contains TRADE records
- Verify matplotlib installation
- Check data integrity


### Cyclic collection issues


- Start with small values (1 min × 10 cycles)
- Data from completed cycles is saved even if interrupted
- Markets appearing only once are not merged
